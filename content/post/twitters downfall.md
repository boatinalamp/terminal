# Prologue

Unless you're living under a rock, you would know that Elon Musk bought Twitter.Â 

## For all the people living in a cave

Twitter is the world's largest micro-blogging app, rivaled only by Koo, it also happens to be the worst place to share your opinion, Rivaled only by a school.

Originally, Twitter was meant to be a place where you could share anything you want - from your daily life to your opinion on the news - 
without having to worry about being suppressed.

## However

At this point, It's turned into a cesspool of controversies and cancel culture.

Twitter is slowly crumbling into the abyss of dead apps, almost fully thanks to a certain multi-billionaire whose name rhymes with "nylon tusk".
