[{"content":"Children all across the world yearn to bring their phones to school, for educational reasons, and to play music on the bus. Should children be allowed to bring phones to school?\nThe downsides Phones would give leeway to a lot of academic dishonor, from cheating on exams to using a calculator in maths class. Having a phone in class would make cheating a lot easier.\nIt would also lead to a lot of liability for the school, as storing a complex electronic device could lead to possible damage to the device, as well as to technological vulnerabilities in the school\u0026rsquo;s ecosystem, making it easier to \u0026ldquo;hack\u0026rdquo; into computers and potentially steal future exam papers/tests.\nIn conclusion I don\u0026rsquo;t think children should be allowed to bring phones to school, as it would put a lot of responsibility on the child, and liability on the school. However, grades above 10th should be allowed to bring electronic devices as the class teacher sees fit.\n","date":"2023-02-05T14:32:23+05:30","image":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4c01eedc2145201d405e67fc8b7165d677cf3dd8/0_40_640_384/master/640.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=1200\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026s=44b2aa45d5708e8d8081f2b75abaa733","permalink":"/p/should-children-bring-phones-to-school/","title":"Should Children Bring Phones to School"},{"content":"Why swimming is good for you Have you ever wondered why so many people choose swimming as their go-to form of exercise?

I mean, Loded Diper has been an iconic name for as long as I can remember Diper Överlode was an unexpected but welcome addition to the Diary of a Wimpy Kid series, although not containing much, it was an enjoyable read for me and all my classmates.\nSpoiler alert! (but you knew that) Educational Value B- Doesn\u0026rsquo;t contain much, but teaches readers the value of music, and how much artists strive for the spotlight, however small that spotlight is. Addition to Story B+ Reveals spoiler alert Loded Dipers origin story and Rodricks inspiration, Thankfully doesn\u0026rsquo;t contain Manny (phew). What it\u0026rsquo;s about In DIARY OF A WIMPY KID: DIPER OVERLODE, Greg doesn\u0026rsquo;t want all the hassle of being famous and losing his privacy. He\u0026rsquo;d rather have famous friends \u0026ndash; or even better, famous family so he always gets expensive gifts for the holidays. He thinks his best bet in that regard is his brother Rodrick, who plays drums in the metal band Loded Diper. Rodrick really wants fame, too, and does everything he can to get the band noticed. Well, everything he can on a budget, that is. Instead of professional band photos, his mom plays photographer in their backyard with her cell phone. Instead of a sweet ride for their band equipment, they acquire an old ice cream truck. When they finally get one track recorded in a studio \u0026ndash; after a scary incident with a swallowed guitar pick \u0026ndash; no one will play the song. When they finally get a gig at a local dive, Rodrick forgets his drumsticks. That puts Greg, their roadie, on the spot to steal a pair in a hurry from a very unlikely, extra creepy place.\n— commonsensemedia.org\nOverall recommend (library-metre) 100% recommend it to a library that allows children to enter and read.

And do they deserve to be prohibited? What are extreme sports? Extreme sports, also commonly referred to as action sports, are competitive sports that are characterized by high risk. Skateboarding, snowboarding, freestyle skiing, and mountain biking are the sports that are most frequently included in this category.\nExtreme sports are typically performed outside the boundaries of traditional mainstream sports and are renowned for their heart-pounding thrills. Motorcycle and snowmobile racing and acrobatic competitions are frequently categorized as \u0026ldquo;extreme,\u0026rdquo; and the term can be interpreted to include risky activities like skydiving and rock climbing.\nHow does one tell the difference? Ask yourself the question, is Soccer an extreme sport?\nNo right?\nYet, More than 775,000 children annually get hospitalized while playing Soccer. And there have been more than 10 deaths ON TV.\nConsider base jumping: what would happen if the wind suddenly changed direction while you were speeding through a canyon?\nWhy do people pursue extreme sports? If you love the swoop in your stomach as you plummet down a swing, wind gushing through your ears, pulling back your hair, Then extreme sports are for you.\nThe thrill of doing something dangerous can only be achieved by doing something dangerous.\nOften people achieve great feats only by assuming a tremendous risk for themselves, take, for example, the act of summating a mountain like Everest, would you do it if it was easy?\nMany extreme sports allow one to feel the freedom to challenge themselves, physically and psychologically.\nDo they deserve to be banned? In Conclusion Even though engaging in extreme sports could be very dangerous, I still believe they should be pursued with well-established safety guidelines and with caution.\nPeople who explore extreme sports, do so with the knowledge of the associated dangers and with the intent of seeking a thrill. Banning extreme sports would be like banning people from summiting Mount Everest.\nHow would you feel if you were banned from sitting on swings simply because of an inherent danger of falling off and hurting yourself?\n","date":"2022-11-25T00:00:00Z","image":"https://www.adventureinyou.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/what-not-to-do-bungee_5_LEAD.jpg","permalink":"/p/extreme-sports/","title":"Extreme Sports"},{"content":"Prologue So I\u0026rsquo;m sure you all have debated about having a dog, whether it be as a companion, guard-dog, or a emotional support pet (in my case, yes).

That’s why I decided to create a blog. To Inspire My audience1 Writing a blog allows one to express ones feelings and air out ones judgements about life, It could also affect the readers life by allowing them to:\nImprove their quality of life. Increase their day\u0026rsquo;s output. Make something lovely. Lend a hand to others. All of this is possible thanks to the power of a blog.\nTo improve my writing ability Starting a blog had made a significant impact on my writing skills, it allowed me to express myself better, Starting out was a little strange and awkward at first. However, after I found something to write about, I found that writing became easier as I got into the swing of things. I was able to speak more effectively, and create a style that is entirely my own (mostly). I gained a solid understanding of how hard it was to write a blog. It challenged my creativity and encouraged me to write on more topics. Win-Win!\nTo confront your fears Blogging gave me a platform to shout from – a way to confront my fear of being noticed, It allowed me to face my fear of being seen. And as a result, I came to the realization that others exist who are just like me. There are numerous additional strategies for using blogging to face your fears. It can be used to get over impostor syndrome and inferiority complexes. Writing about a subject that makes you uncomfortable can be cathartic and aid in the release of those feelings.\nIt could even be a journal In fact, a lot of individuals use blogging as a tool to support them in their battles with mental health. This demonstrates that starting a blog doesn\u0026rsquo;t always have to be a carefully thought-out project. It may simply be a place for you to gather your thoughts at times. Let us return to the beginnings of blogging. A blog was a place where you could write about your daily life. I think I have an old dear-diary style book dedicated to that somewhere. However, just because it has fallen out of favor in recent years does not preclude you from starting a blog for that reason. Blogging about your life is an excellent way to reflect. To some extent, past joys and mistakes can be learned from. Having a place to keep your memories can help you see how far you\u0026rsquo;ve come and how much you\u0026rsquo;ve learned.\nConclusion Starting a blog has advantages and disadvantages, and there is no one-size-fits-all solution.\nConsider both sides of the argument and weigh them against your own personality, lifestyle, and ambitions when deciding whether or not to start a blog. Examine your options and be honest about what you truly want from the experience.\nYou\u0026rsquo;ll be the one doing the work, and you\u0026rsquo;ll be the one reaping the benefits in the end.

Not a sprint.\u0026rdquo; - Robert McKee\nHeavily Inspired from this blog.\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n","date":"2022-11-17T18:20:26+05:30","permalink":"/p/why-i-made-this-blog/","title":"Why I Made This Blog"}]
