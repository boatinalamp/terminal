Im sure all of you can guess by the title, that there&rsquo;s alot of potty humor in this. I mean, Loded Diper has been an iconic name for as long as I can remember
Diper Överlode was an unexpected but welcome addition to the <a href="https://www.amazon.in/s?k=diary+of+a+wimpy+kid+book+sets&amp;adgrpid=62819624395&amp;ext_vrnc=hi&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQiA1ZGcBhCoARIsAGQ0kkqv4FexzJHIaPKxvzc3Phkz8psnuPHxgZ_HVB9dOJgj1AG_VYMKJUcaApG4EALw_wcB&amp;hvadid=590652605956&amp;hvdev=c&amp;hvlocphy=9062088&amp;hvnetw=g&amp;hvqmt=b&amp;hvrand=16181495951405344527&amp;hvtargid=kwd-300731490699&amp;hydadcr=24511_2265429&amp;tag=googinhydr1-21&amp;ref=pd_sl_7m4y3ru8y6_b">Diary of a Wimpy Kid</a> series, although not containing much, it was an enjoyable read for me and all my classmates.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In DIARY OF A WIMPY KID: DIPER OVERLODE, Greg doesn&rsquo;t want all the hassle of being famous and losing his privacy. He&rsquo;d rather have famous friends &ndash; or even better, famous family so he always gets expensive gifts for the holidays. He thinks his best bet in that regard is his brother Rodrick, who plays drums in the metal band Loded Diper. Rodrick really wants fame, too, and does everything he can to get the band noticed. Well, everything he can on a budget, that is. Instead of professional band photos, his mom plays photographer in their backyard with her cell phone. Instead of a sweet ride for their band equipment, they acquire an old ice cream truck. When they finally get one track recorded in a studio &ndash; after a scary incident with a swallowed guitar pick &ndash; no one will play the song. When they finally get a gig at a local dive, Rodrick forgets his drumsticks. That puts Greg, their roadie, on the spot to steal a pair in a hurry from a very unlikely, extra creepy place.</p>

<h2 id="overall-recommend-library-metre">Overall recommend (library-metre)</h2>
<p>100% recommend it to a library that allows children to enter and read. This book has some great values (like saying no to vandalising) and some really good english.</p>
