        <p><em>This is for an English assignment, and is extremely incomplete</em> <br>
It was Tuesday and I had a long sports class at school. I was very tired. On the bus ride home, I was excited to see my dog Chewie. He always greeted me at the door with excitement, showing me his toys and asking for treats. Usually, we played for about ten minutes. But when I got home and opened the door, Chewie wasn&rsquo;t there. I searched for him and found him under my study desk, looking tired.</p>
<p>When Chewie saw me, he perked up a little, but still seemed tired. I gave him some water to drink, which helped a bit. Then, I took him outside to play and made him run around in a field near our home. He was very happy and energetic after that.</p>
<h2 id="what-you-should-do-in-this-situation">What you should do in this situation.</h2>
<p>If your dog is looking a little tired, give him/her some water and food, and try playing with him/her for a while, if he/she stays tired, consider getting an appointment at a veterinarian near you. As your dog might be sick, In my case, he just needed a little love and attention.</p>
